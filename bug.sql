The SQL query uses the `LIMIT` clause without an `ORDER BY` clause. This can lead to unpredictable results, as the database system is free to return any arbitrary subset of the rows that satisfy the `WHERE` clause.  For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
```

This query selects 10 employees, but which 10? Without `ORDER BY`, it's undefined.  The result may vary across different database systems, different versions of the same system, or even across different executions of the same query. 

Another issue is using `TOP` (in some databases) without `ORDER BY`, which suffers the same problem as `LIMIT`.

Further,  incorrectly using `WHERE` clauses with `LIKE` without proper escaping can lead to unexpected behavior and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example, if a user-supplied value is directly incorporated into a LIKE clause without proper escaping, an attacker might inject malicious SQL code.
